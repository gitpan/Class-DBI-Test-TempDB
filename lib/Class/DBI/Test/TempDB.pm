=head1 Description

In testing, we generally want tests to create and destroy all their own data.
When writing Class::DBI-based projects, it's helpful to have a test database in
which to do this, so that we can (a) be sure we're not stepping on production
data, and (b) be sure of exactly what data is in the test database at the
beginning/end of each test.

Class::DBI::Test::TempDB handles the creation and destruction of a temporary
SQLite database on disk; it also allows you to point your Class::DBI classes at
the test database. You can then get on with creating, testing and destroying
test data simply by interacting with your Class::DBI classes.

The database can be persistent between tests, or it can be recreated for each
test, from a YAML file describing the schema to be created. It can be stored in
a temp file, or in a file with a user-supplied name.

Everything is done through class methods and subclassing.

=head1 Methods

=head2 build_connection

If supplied a parameter, that parameter is used as the name of a database file
to be built (or connected to, if it already exists). If not, creates a
temporary file (using File::Temp). Once the file is created, this method
initializes a SQLite db in it, and points our package connection at it.

=cut

sub build_connection {
    my ($class, $filename) = @_;
    my $DB;
    if ($filename) {
        $DB = $filename;
    } else {
        (undef, $DB) = tempfile();
    }

    $class->dbfile($DB);

    my @DSN = ($class->dsn, '', '', { AutoCommit => 1 });
    $class->set_db(Main => @DSN);
}

=head2 dsn

Returns the string 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=' . <the name of the database file being used>

=cut

sub dsn {
    my $class = shift;
    return "dbi:SQLite:dbname=" . $class->dbfile;
}

=head2 tear_down_connection 

Removes the database file, if it still exists.

=cut

sub tear_down_connection {
    my $class = shift;
    unlink $class->dbfile if (-e $class->dbfile);
}

=head2 connect_class_to_test_db

Overrides the db_Main() method of the passed-in CDBI entity class so that it
calls our db_Main() instead. This is the methodology suggested by the CDBI
documentation for dynamically changing a class's database connection. NB the
warnings there about already-existing instances of the entity class: that is,
this should probably only be done at the beginning of a test script, before any
objects have been instantiated in the entity class.


=cut

sub connect_class_to_test_db {
    my ($class, $entityClass) = @_;

    # don't re-connect the class to our test db if the class is already
    # using it:
    unless ($class->db_Main == $entityClass->db_Main) {
        eval qq{
            sub ${entityClass}::db_Main {
                return $class->db_Main;
            }
        };
        die $@ if $@;
    }
}


=head2 build_test_db

 MyClass::DBI::Test->build_test_db(<$yaml, $dbfile>);

Given the path to a YAML file representing the schema of our production
database, generate a test SQLite database and use it.

By default, $yaml is 'config.yaml' and $dbfile is a temp file (we use
File::Temp, which see for details).

The YAML file is expected to be in the format produced by SQL::Translator
(which see for details); here's an example of a way to produce such a YAML file
from a MySQL database called 'mydatabase':

  mysqldump -d mydatabase | perl -MSQL::Translator -e 
    'my $sql = join "", <STDIN>; my $trans = SQL::Translator->new; 
    print $trans->translate(from => "MySQL", to => "YAML", data => $sql);' 
    > config.yaml

=begin testing

ok(Class::DBI::Test::TempDB->build_test_db('t/files/config.yaml', 't/files/testdb.sqlite'),
    'build test database');
ok(-e 't/files/testdb.sqlite', 'db file created');
ok(Class::DBI::Test::TempDB->tear_down_connection, 'tear_down_connection');
ok(!(-e 't/files/testdb.sqlite'), 'db file removed');

=end testing

=cut

sub build_test_db {
    my ($class, $yaml, $filename) = @_;
    $yaml ||= 'config.yaml';
    $filename ||= '';
    my $trans = SQL::Translator->new;
    my $sqlite_schema = $trans->translate(
        from => "YAML", to => "SQLite", filename => $yaml) or
        die $trans->error;

    # In order to execute the dumped sqlite schema statements against
    # our dbh, we have to get rid of comments (lines starting with "--") and
    # skip BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT lines:

    my @lines = split "\n", $sqlite_schema;
    my @filtered_lines = grep {
        $_ !~ /^\-\-/;
    } @lines;

    $sqlite_schema = join "\n", @filtered_lines;

    my @statements = split /;/, $sqlite_schema;

    unlink $filename if (-e $filename);

    $class->build_connection($filename);

    # execute dumped sql schema against dbh:
    foreach (@statements) {
        next if /^BEGIN\sTRANSACTION/;
        next if /^\W*COMMIT/;
        $class->db_Main->do($_) or warn $class->db_Main->errstr;
    }

    return $class->db_Main;
}

=head1 Limitations

Of course, this module can only handle things that SQLite can handle.
